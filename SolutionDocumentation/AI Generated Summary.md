ATAP.Utilities. Ignore all directories and files that correspond to the contents of .gitignore, and ignore the .git subdirectory. This is a multi-project repository root. The subprojects starting with ATAP.Utilities are intended to create assembly libraries (those written in c#) and subprojects whose files are written in PowerShell, are intended to create PowerShell modules. Subprojects that start with ATAP.Console are intended to create console programs. Files ending in .md or .txt are documentation files for the subprojects. Sub-projects that start with ATAP.Services are intended to create objects that can plug into a pluggable framework via dependency injection. Prepare a report that

## 1. Repository Structure

The **ATAP.Utilities** GitHub repository is a multi‑project solution containing:

- **C# class‑library projects** `ATAP.Utilities.*` – reusable .NET Standard / .NET libraries.
- **C# console applications** `ATAP.Console.*` – developer tools for data extraction / transformation.
- **PowerShell modules** – build and release automation scripts.
- **Service wrappers** `ATAP.Services.*` – DI‑ready adapters that plug the utilities into host apps.
- **Documentation & build assets** – Markdown, PlantUML, DocFX, MSBuild custom targets, etc.

The directory tree is governed by a central _Directory.Build.props_ and MSBuild SDK‑style projects.
Output, IDE settings, and other transient artefacts are excluded by **.gitignore**.

## 5. Remarks

- The repository embraces **“everything‑as‑code”** – build, documentation, and versioning are encoded in source.
- Libraries aim for **zero‑package‑locking** – e.g., _Serializer_ defers concrete JSON engine choice.
- Service adapters promote clean DI registration (e.g., `services.AddAtapLogging()`).
- Console utilities double as reference implementations for the libraries.
