# An overview of the data structures for Predicates, Categories, and Tags in the ATAP-AIAssist VSC extension

array means array in languages that don't utilize  dotnet .Net such as Typescript and javascript, and means ArrayList in languages that do support dotnet .Net such as c# and Powershell.
If asked for an implementation, Omit nothing, generating all types, classes, and methods requested.
if asked for an implementation in a specific language, use the common conventions for naming variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers.
All Types defined are of generic Type<T> where T is constrined to types GUID and Int, and should include a constructor and and ToString() methods. The type also includes static methods for convertTo_json, convertFrom_json, convertTo_yaml, convertFrom_yaml,.
The type Philote has a read-only property named ID of type T, and an array of other Philote instances named Friends.
The type Category has a Philote instance and a read-only property of type string.
The type Categorys has a Philote instance and an array of type Category.
The type Tag has a Philote instance and a string.
The type Tags has a Philote instance and an array of type Tag.
The type Predicate has a Philote instance, a read-only property of type string, a read-only property of type Categorys, and a read-only property of type Tags.
The type Predicates has a Philote instance and an array of type Predicate.

Produce the plantUML statements necessary to graphically describe the following data structures:

Produce the Typescript necessary to implement the following.

Produce the c# necessary to implement the following data structures:

Produce a settings structure for a VSC extension suitable for inclusion in the "configuration": section of packages.json that will store the Categories, Tags, and Predicates defined in the following data structures.


Given typescriptcode like this in a file named Philote.ts .for a VSC extension, write test case code for VSC extension tests that will test all the methods

``` Typescript
export type GUID = string;
export type Int = number;
export type IDType = GUID | Int;

// Utility methods for JSON and YAML conversion. YAML conversion is done with js-yaml
const toJson = (obj: any): string => JSON.stringify(obj);
const fromJson = <T>(json: string): T => JSON.parse(json);
const toYaml = (obj: any): string => yaml.dump(obj);
const fromYaml = <T>(yamlString: string): T => yaml.load(yamlString) as T;

export class Philote<T extends IDType> {
  readonly ID: T;
  others: Philote<T>[];

  constructor(ID: T) {
    this.ID = ID;
    this.others = [];
  }

  convertTo_json(): string {
    return toJson(this);
  }

  static convertFrom_json<T extends IDType>(json: string): Philote<T> {
    return fromJson<Philote<T>>(json);
  }

  convertTo_yaml(): string {
    return toYaml(this);
  }

  static convertFrom_yaml<T extends IDType>(yaml: string): Philote<T> {
    return fromYaml<Philote<T>>(yaml);
  }

  ToString(): string {
    return `Philote: ${this.ID}`;
  }
}
```
