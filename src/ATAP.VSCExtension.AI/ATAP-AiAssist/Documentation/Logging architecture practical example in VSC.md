## Here's a more detailed and structured version of your blog article that incorporates the specifics of logging within a Visual Studio Code extension, including the use of loggers in class constructors and method decorators.

## Enhancing Observability Through Scoped Logging and Visual Hierarchy Representation

Logging is a cornerstone of observability in software development, providing critical insights into application behavior and performance. Scoped logging, in particular, plays a vital role by identifying the location within a program hierarchy from which log messages originate. This article explores the concept of scoped logging and how to visually represent program hierarchy through logging, highlighting the balance between storage space and execution speed.

### The Importance of Logging

Logging serves several essential functions:- **Debugging:** Tracing execution flow and identifying errors.- **Monitoring:** Providing real-time insights into application performance.- **Auditing:** Maintaining a record of events for security and compliance purposes.

### Scoped Logging

Scoped logging enhances traditional logging by attaching contextual information about the location within the codebase where the log message was generated. This context, or scope, helps developers understand the origin of log messages without ambiguity.

### Logger Interfaces in ATAP Libraries

Within the ATAP libraries, there are several logger interfaces, each tailored to different environments and use cases:

1. **Visual Studio Code Extension Logger:**   - **File:** `ATAPlogger.ts`   - **Functionality:** Uses a `scope` field to track the program entity name. By convention, the first argument of the parameter list is a logger. The constructor of the object creates a new logger and stores the program entity identifier in the `scope` field. This approach is runtime space-intensive because it concatenates each element of the program tree into a single string and stores it for each program hierarchy element.
2. **PowerShell Logger:**   - **Used In:** PowerShell scripts   - **Functionality:** Provides structured logging, supporting field inclusion/exclusion and log transformations such as date format changes. It can also handle logging transport for systems like OpenTelemetry and Windows ETL.
3. **C# Loggers:**   - **Used In:** C# libraries   - **Functionality:** Similar to the PowerShell logger, it supports structured logging and transformations, ensuring consistency across different logging systems.
4. **Windows ETL System:**   - **Functionality:** Used for high-performance logging in Windows environments. Integrates with structured logging principles, allowing for comprehensive data collection and analysis.

### Implementing Scoped Logging in Visual Studio Code Extensions

In a Visual Studio Code extension, logging instances are created in different contexts to capture detailed information about the execution flow. Let's explore how loggers are instantiated and used within this environment.

#### Initial Logger Creation

When the extension is activated, a logger is created manually, passing it an empty scope or perhaps a scope of the extension name:

````typescript
// logger.tsclass Logger {    private scope: string[];
    constructor(scope: string[] = []) {        this.scope = scope;    }
    log(logLevel: string, message: string) {        console.log(`[${logLevel}] [${this.scope.join(' -> ')}] ${message}`);    }}
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {    const logger = new Logger(['ExtensionName']);    logger.log('INFO', 'Extension activated');    // Register commands and other activation code}```
#### Logger in Class Constructors
Loggers are created within class constructors using an opinionated format:
```typescriptclass SomeComponent {    private logger: Logger;
    constructor(parentLogger: Logger) {        this.logger = new Logger([...parentLogger.scope, 'SomeComponent']);        this.logger.log('INFO', 'Component initialized');    }}
````

#### Method Decorators for Logging

For logging method execution, decorators are used, though they introduce overhead due to multiple jumps and copies. This could be optimized or inlined for production code to balance code size and execution speed.

```typescript
function logMethod(logLevel: string) {    return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {        const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
        descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {            if (this.logger && typeof this.logger.log === 'function') {                const methodLogger = new Logger([...this.logger.scope, propertyKey]);                methodLogger.log(logLevel, `Starting ${propertyKey}`);                                const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
                methodLogger.log(logLevel, `Ended ${propertyKey}`);                return result;            }            return originalMethod.apply(this, args);        };
        return descriptor;    };}
class SomeComponent {    private logger: Logger;
    constructor(parentLogger: Logger) {        this.logger = new Logger([...parentLogger.scope, 'SomeComponent']);    }
    @logMethod('DEBUG')    performTask() {        this.logger.log('INFO', 'Performing task');        // Task execution code    }}
```

#### Handling the Log Constructor Decorator

The log constructor decorator cannot rely on the method used for functions because the class does not yet exist. Instead, it relies on the logger being the first parameter passed, and the class immediately creates a new logger.

```typescript
class AnotherComponent {
  private logger: Logger;
  constructor(parentLogger: Logger) {
    this.logger = new Logger([...parentLogger.scope, "AnotherComponent"]);
    this.logger.log("INFO", "AnotherComponent initialized");
  }
}
```

### Visual Representation of Program Hierarchy

Each element of the program hierarchy has an identifier that can either be a visual representation of the program element or a pointer to such a representation. To create a visual representation of the program hierarchy, a concatenation function combines these elements, forming a clear hierarchical structure.

#### Storage and Performance Trade-offs

The method of storing these identifiers significantly impacts the application's speed and storage requirements:1. **Isolated Identifiers:** Every element is isolated, requiring traversal of the entire hierarchy. This method is space-efficient but can be slow.2. **Precomputed Elements:** Every runtime element is precomputed and stored, minimizing creation time but consuming more storage.3. **Hybrid Approach:** Precompute visual representations for common elements and use a combination of jump tables for less common elements. This balances speed and storage requirements.

### Example of Visual Representation

Consider the following visual representation of program hierarchy through scoped logging:

1. **Concatenation Function:** Combines visual representations of program elements.
2. **Logger Chain:** Walks back through the hierarchy to build the chain.

#### Structured Logging

Structured logging formats log entries consistently, often in JSON, allowing for easy parsing and visualization.

```json
{
  "Timestamp": "2024-05-28T12:34:56Z",
  "Level": "Information",
  "Message": "Performing a task.",
  "Scope": ["Main", "PerformTask"]
}
```

### Visualization Tools (ToDo)

Tools like the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Seq, and Splunk can visualize log data, reflecting the hierarchical structure.

#### Using Kibana (ToDo)

1. **Ingest Logs:** Use Logstash to parse and ingest structured logs into Elasticsearch.
2. **Create Index Patterns:** Define index patterns in Kibana for your logs.
3. **Build Visualizations:** Create hierarchical views of logs using Kibana’s visualization tools.

### Conclusion

Effective logging is crucial for observability, with scoped logging providing the necessary contextual clarity. By structuring log data and using object arrays for scope identifiers, developers can create a clear, hierarchical representation of log messages while optimizing runtime space and performance. Balancing storage and performance trade-offs is key to optimizing logging in large-scale applications.

This version aims to clearly explain the concepts and implementation of scoped logging and visual representation, with a focus on the specific logger interfaces in ATAP libraries, and includes the optimization using object arrays for scope identifiers. This should make it suitable as an explanation of the architecture and design of the Logger object and its use within the ATAP-AiAssist VSC extension Typescript package.
