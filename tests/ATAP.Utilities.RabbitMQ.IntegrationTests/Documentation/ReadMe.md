# Notes on testing RabbitMQ

## Setup

RabbitMQ installed via chocolaty. Only default values. Validated that the admin .bat files worked. Could not find the installation direcotry in the path, added it to the path manually. Bat files worked direct from the terminal after that.

## Other programs using RabbitMQ

The VoiceAttack Plugin developed under ATAP.Utilities is a user of the RabbitMQ system.
