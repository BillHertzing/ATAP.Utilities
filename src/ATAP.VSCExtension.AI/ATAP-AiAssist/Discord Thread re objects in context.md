xState noob here...

I've been exploring the use of XState for managing user interaction and document fetching in a VSC extension. However, I've encountered a specific challenge that I'm hoping to get some guidance on. Most examples and documentation I've read demonstrate the use of scalar values in the config section of a state machine. However, I was wondering if it is possible to supply an an entire object, specifically an instance of an "IData" interface (see below), when the actor is initialized /started?

How can I pass an instance of an IData interface to the config section of my state machine in XState? Are there any best practices or patterns I should follow? Additionally, I would like to understand how the state machine can interact with this IData instance throughout its states and transitions (using the getters and setters, both sync and async, in the Manager instances), and any potential pitfalls or performance considerations I should be aware of when supplying complex objects to a state machine.

I would greatly appreciate any examples, advice, or resources you could share regarding this topic. Thank you in advance for your help!

export interface IData {
readonly configurationData: IConfigurationData; // getters for properties that return a value from (in priority order) argv, env, DefaultConfiguration.Development, DefaultConfiguration.Testing, DefaultConfiguration.Production...
readonly stateManager: IStateManager; // getters and async setters for a cache-fronted access to the VSC global state storage for an extension
readonly secretsManager: ISecretsManager; // async getters for property values stored in various 3rd-party password managers
readonly fileManager: IFileManager; // async getters and async setters for large collections stored in filesystem storage as JSON or YAML encoded strings, with updating the filesystem on command or on disposeAsync
disposeAsync(): void; // called during extension deactivation, calls disposeAsync() on each of the Managers. Resolves when all Managers have resolved their disposeAsync() methods.
// If a manager supplies objects that needs disposing of, the manager uses a factory pattern and records each object that is handed out, so that all of them can be properly disposed of during extension deactivation
}

Passing input objects to invoked Actors
xState noob here...
I've created a simple three state machine (InitialState, SecondState, FinalState), and have successfully imported an object (data:IData) into the machine and logged it to the console. In the 'Second State', I can successfully invoke an actor defined inline. But I'm having trouble figuring out how to pass objects to the input of the invoked actor. I've read the many sections on input quite a few times, but no luck getting the syntax I need correct...Any help wouild be appreciated

```Typescript
export const minimalMachineWithActorMachine = createMachine(
  {
    types: {
      context: {} as { logger: ILogger; data: IData },
      input: {} as { logger: ILogger; data: IData },
      events: {} as { type: 'C1' },
    },
    context: ({ input }) => ({ logger: input.logger, data: input.data }),
    id: 'minimalMachineWithActorMachine',
    initial: 'Initial State',
    states: { /* ... */
	'Second State': {
        entry: {
          type: 'SecondStateEntryAction',
        },
        invoke: {
          src: 'SecondStateActor',
          // The input stanza below is wrong, its where I'm havingproblems understanding...
          input: ({  logger:ILogger, data:IData }) => ({
            logger: logger,
            data: data,
          }),
          onDone: {
            target: 'Final State',
          },
        },
      },
	  /*... */
	  },
  },
  {
    actors:{
	// *  again, the input sections below throw a bunch of errors, and ${logger} ${data} "can't be found"
        SecondStateActor: fromPromise(async ({ logger:ILogger, data:IData }) => {
            console.log(`Second State invoke called`);
            console.log(`logger: ${logger}`);
            console.log(`data: ${data}`);
            await true;
            let pick: string = 'ABC';
            return pick;
          })
    },
	 actions: { /* ...*/
	 },
  },
);

const mMWAActor = createActor(minimalMachineWithActorMachine, {
    input:{
        logger: new Logger(),
        data: new Data()
    }
});
```

AAI StateMachine

a parent machine with an Idle state, FirstState, FinalState and ErrorState. The primary machine accepts an input parameter called loggerData that is of type ILoggerData {interface ILoggerData = logger:ILogger, data:Idata}. The event 'triggerFirstStateEvent' causes the transition from Idle to FirstState. It supplies the input loggerData parameter and also a parameter named 'enumToChangeType' of an enumeration type 'EnumToChangeType', having values 'Mode' and 'Command'. FirstState is a Parentstate with a child state 'ShowAndSelectEnumValueState', and a second child state 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumState'. 'ShowAndSelectEnumValueState' has an invoked actor that invokes the 'ShowAndSelectEnumValueLogic'. 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumState' has an invoked actor that invokes the 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumStateLogic'. The 'ShowAndSelectEnumValueLogic' calls an async function 'GetUserInput', which has two parameters: 'loggerData: ILoggerData, enumToChangeType: EnumToChangeType, and returns a value of 'QuickPickItem |udefined' to be stored in a local constant 'pick'. If 'pick.label' is 'undefined; the state transitions to the parent machine's 'Idle' state. if 'pick.label' === data.pickItems.currentMode ;' the state transitions to the parent machine's 'Idle' state. otherwise, the state transitions to the 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumState', and supplies the loggerData, the. ' enumToChangeType ', and the pick.label as dynamic parameters to the 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumState' and the 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumStateLogic'. The 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumStateLogic' sets a local 'constant priorEnumValue = data.pickItems.currentMode' and a local 'constant newEnumvalue - pick. label as ModeItmeEnum' The actor performs a switch statement on each possible pair of priorEnum and newEnumValue , and calls further invoked actor logic. Those actor logic names follow the pattern 'Change<priorEnumValue>To<newEnumValue>ActorLogic. Create placeholder instances for the source of those functions. Each should simply return onDone, or have an OnError event handler that transitions to the primary Machine's onError, supplying to the parent machines OnError state the reason why the 'furtherInvokedActorLogic' failed When the 'furtherInvokedActorLogic' completes successfully, the 'ChangeCurrentValueofEnumState' should have an exit action that calls the function 'data.stateManger.currentMode = pick.label'.

Best Practices for structuring the statemachine files?

xState noob here...
I expect the primary machine definition for my application to get pretty large. I'd like to modularize it to a big degree, so no single file grows too large. I have some states/actors/actions/transitions that are both self-contained and reused/triggered by the same top-level event, having different event data. Is it 'better' to have these groups coded as parent states with multiple child states in the primary machine's definition, or 'better' to create a 'child state machine' using a seperate .ts file, and invoking the 'child state machine' in the state which would be the parent in the parent-child architecture? It seems to me that having the logic in the 'child state machine' file would be 'better' (in the sense of reducing the line count in the primary machine definition's .ts file). All the internal states, internal transitions, entry/exit actions, guards, type defintions for a group would be in one file, with just the calling state defined in the primary file. Are there any 'cons' to building multiple 'child state machines', or, is this the best way to approach code reuse vs parent states?

Thank you for that insight! I spent the morning building the child machine, and I'd like to get that working before I refactor it away :). The documentation says 'Any XState actor can be invoked, including simple Promise-based actors, or even complex machine-based actors.' I can 'invoke' an instance of a PromiseLogic (created with fromPromise) with no problem. But I can't seem to figure out how to invoke a machine-based actor from a state? I have a breakpoint on the first line of the invoked instance of the machineLogic (built by calling createMachine) and it is not being reached. But the state's Entry action is being called, and it seems to be immediately transitioning to onError without executing any of the child machine logic. If I 'invoke' an instance of a createMachine({...}), do I also need to create an actor and start that actor? and if so, where?

I have a file qPMachineLogic.ts with

```Typescript
export const quickPickMachineLogic = createMachine({...})
```

and a file pMachine.ts with

```Typescript
export const primaryMachine = createMachine ({
 context: {} as { loggerData: ILoggerData },
 input: {} as { loggerData: ILoggerData },
 events: {} as
  | { type: 'QUICKPICK_EVENT', kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration}
  | { type: 'Error' }
  | { type: 'Dispose' }
  | { type: 'DisposeComplete' },
 id: 'primaryMachine',
 initial: 'idle',
 states: {
  idle: {
   on: {
    QUICKPICK_EVENT: {
     target: 'quickPickState',
    },
    ...
   ,
  },
  quickPickState: {
   invoke: {
    id: 'quickPickActor', // how do I create and start the child Actor based on the following machineLogic?
    src: quickPickMachineLogic,
    input: ({ context, event }) => ({
     logger: context.loggerData.logger,
     data: context.loggerData.data,
     // kindOfEnumeration: event.kindOfEnumeration
     // the commented line above fails with the error: "Property 'kindOfEnumeration' does not exist on type '{ type: "quickPick"; kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration; } | { type: "Error"; } | { type: "Dispose"; } | { type: "DisposeComplete"; }'. Property 'kindOfEnumeration' does not exist on type '{ type: "Error"; }'
     // the following line suggested by GitHub Copilot, it compiles, but ... Will every additional payload field in other events require a similar guard?
     kindOfEnumeration: event.type === 'quickPick' ? (event as { type: 'quickPick', quickPickKindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration }).kindOfEnumeration : undefined,
    }),
    onDone: [...],
    onError: [...],
    },
   },
  ...
})

I've no idea where to create and start the child quickPickActor?


struggling with actions: and assign() in handling the onDone event of an invoked actor.

VSC extensions have an async UI command 'vscode.window.showQuickPick'. I want a state that will invoke actor logic, then update context based on the result.
The state is named 'quickPickState' and is transitioned into via the 'QUICKPICK_EVENT'.
the 'QUICKPICK_EVENT' is defined in setup->types->events as ' |{ type: 'QUICKPICK_EVENT'; kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration }'
'QuickPickEnumeration' is an enumeration that lists the enumerations that can be shown/selected with 'vscode.window.showQuickPick'
'quickPickState' invokes a service (src:) named 'showQuickPickActorLogic'
the input: stanza is
```

input: ({ context, event }) => ({
logger: context.logger,
data: context.data,
kindOfEnumeration:
event.type === 'QUICKPICK_EVENT'
? (event as { type: 'QUICKPICK_EVENT'; kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration })
.kindOfEnumeration
: undefined,
}),

```

A) the 'showQuickPickActorLogic' actor logic should:
  1) create the contents of the parameters for showQuickPick based off the input.data and input.kindOfEnumeration
  2) await a call to 'vscode.window.showQuickPick'
  3) return the value entered by the user. The returned value has different shapes depending on the value of 'kindOfEnumeration'. The following interfaces and uniontype define the shape of the data to be returned
```

export interface IQuickPickActorLogicModeOutput {
kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration;
newMode: ModeMenuItemEnum;
}
export interface IQuickPickActorLogicCommandOutput {
kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration;
newCommand: CommandMenuItemEnum;
}
export interface IQuickPickActorLogicQueryEnginesOutput {
kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration;
newQueryEngineFlags: QueryEngineFlagsEnum;
}
export interface IQuickPickActorLogicVCSCommandOutput {
kindOfEnumeration: QuickPickEnumeration;
newVCSCommand: StatusMenuItemEnum;
}
export type showQuickPickActorLogicOutputTypeUnion =
| IQuickPickActorLogicModeOutput
| IQuickPickActorLogicCommandOutput
| IQuickPickActorLogicQueryEnginesOutput
| IQuickPickActorLogicVCSCommandOutput;

````

B) the onDone action should
  1) look at the value of 'kindOfEnumeration' to determine the shape of the data it has received, and then switch on the 'kindOfEnumeration'
    when 'Mode' or 'Command' => assign to a 'currentMode or 'currentCommand' found in context.data. I'm using (e.g., when kindOfEnumeration is 'ModeMenuItems'
    ```Typescript
      assignAction = assign({
        ...context.data,
        stateManager: { ...context.data.stateManager, currentMode: (data as IQuickPickActorLogicModeOutput).newMode },
      });
````

code structure setup->create->provide?

Reading the recent discord threads about v5 Actors and basics of provice and createMachine, the most recent impromptue podcast on actors, and the V5 documentation... I still have questions :-)

It looks like the suggested structure is
setup: identify the things (context shape, input shape, states, actions, actors, events, guards to be used in the machine, and specify (at least the shapes of the inputs /output/payloads)
create: structure these things into the flow of states, events, actions, invoked actors, and guards.
provide (optional): write the ts code that implements the 'things' that were defined in setup. This is required if setup just defined the shapes of inputs and outputs, and optional if setup defined the entire default logic in addition to the shapes of inputs and outputs.

However, I'm still floundering. I've spent about three days trying to figure out how to even ask the questions I need answers to. I have tried to come up with the smallest possible machine that illustrates where I'm stuck. Inline in comments are the places where I need better understanding. Any pointers would be much appreciated.

(I also have earlier, more complex iterations on codesandbox and on stately, but the following post is the minimalist machine I've come up with.)

,
import \* as vscode from 'vscode';

export enum EN1{
En1EL1
}

export enum EN2{
En2EL1
}

export enum QuickPickEnumeration {
EN1,
EN2
}

export const reallySimpleQPMachine = setup({
types{} as {
context: { logger: ILogger; data: IData };
input: { logger: ILogger; data: IData };
events:
| QP1: {kindOfEnumeration:QuickPickEnumeration, cTSId: string}
}
actors: {
QPActorLogic: () =>{ //what goes into the first () to specify the shape of the input and the shape of the output?
return { kindOfEnumeration: input.kindOfEnumeration, pickLabel: pick.label };
}}, // the QPActorLogis is a 'FromPromise'
// I'm unsure of where and how to declare the shape of the input to this 'FromPromise' actor
// The input is as shaped below in the definitions of the QPState
// The onDone event's payload should look like {kindOfEnumeration:QuickPickEnumeration, pickLabel:string, cTSId: string}
}
actions: {
modifyContextAction: {() =>{}}, // needs to return a 'thing' that 'fit', as an argument to assign in the QPState OnDone
// This needs to return one of three things
//{...context.data,stateManager: {...context.data.stateManager,currentEN1: eventData.pickLabel as EN1,},}
//{...context.data,stateManager: {...context.data.stateManager,currentEN2: eventData.pickLabel as EN2,},}
//{...context.data,cTSManager: {...context.data.cTSManager.remove(context.data.cTSManager.FindByID(cTSId)),},}
// the logic to decide which to return is based on the onDone event's payload
}
}).createMachine ({
id:'m1';
context: ({ input }) => ({ logger: input.logger, data: input.data }),
initial: 'idleState',
states: {
idleState: {
on: {
QP1: {
target: QPState
},
},
},
QPState: {
description:
"A state that allows a user to see a list of available enumeration values, pick one, updates the 'currentValue' of the enumeration in the context, and then returns to the idleState..

src: QPActorLogic, // identify the source of the invoked logic for this state

: undefined,
, cTS: vscode.CancellationTokenSource
)},
onDone { // what happens when the QPActorLogic resolves the promise
target: idleState
action:[
// the modifyContextAction should return something that will fit the expected parameter type for 'assign'
// I'm unsure how to pass the onDone event's payload into the modifyContextAction
assign(modifyContextAction),
],
}
},
}
})

Ah - I think I've found how to articulate my issue. I'm having trouble with the intersection of actions, and conditional assigns. The doc for 'assign-action' says 'Assignments can be an object of key-value pairs where the keys are context keys and the values are either static values or expressions that return the new value:' In QPState, it invokes a fromPromise actor (qPActorLogic), and returns an enumeration and a string (data in done_invoke_QPActorLogic_Event). In the onDone actions: entry, the goal is to assign the string to one of multiple context properties based on the value of the enueration, and call a Remove method on a property of the context.
I'm stuck trying to define the updateContext and invoke the UpdateContext

enum CEnum {
C1 = 'C1',
C2 = 'C2',
}
enum MEnum {
M1 = 'M1',
M2 = 'M2',
}
enum Kenum {
Cenum = 'Cenum',
Menum = 'Menum',
}

// there is a State QPState and it invokes a fromPromise actor qPActorLogic that returns a done_invoke_QPActorLogic_Event
type done_invoke_QPActorLogic_Event = {
// this is a psuedo name for the event
type: 'done.invoke.QPActorLogic_Event';
data: { k: Kenum; cTSId: string, s:string };
};

// This is psuedocode for how the context should be modified when done_invoke_QPActorLogic_Event arrives....
// I cannot get the magic sauce for the correct syntax declaring this function
function updateContext({ context: { logger: ILogger; data: IData }, event: done_invoke_QPActorLogic_Event }) => {
if (event.type === 'done.invoke.QPActorLogic_Event' && event.data.k === Kenum.Menum) {
context.data.stateManager.currentMode = event.data.s as MEnum;// psuedocode for what the assign should do...
// maybe like this? but this is incorrect, it doesn't recognize context or event correctly...
// assign({
// ...context.data,
// stateManager: {
// ...context.data.stateManager,
// currentMode: (
// event as { type: 'done.invoke.QPActorLogic_Event'; data: { k: Kenum; cTSId: string, s:string } }
// ).data.s as MEnum,
// },
}
if (event.type === 'done.invoke.QPActorLogic_Event' && event.data.k === Kenum.Cenum) {
context.data.stateManager.currentCmd = event.data.s as CEnum; // psuedocode for what the assign should do...
}
context.data.cTSManager.cTSCollection.Remove(event.data.cTSId); // does this even require an assign action?
// Note that the updateContext should perform two assignments, one for the enum value and one to remove the cTSId from the CtsCollection
};

// The QPState should have an onDone entry that implements the intent of the updateContext above,
onDone: [
{
target: 'updateUIState',
actions: [
// ?????
{
type: 'updateContext', // I assume this should be an action Object with dynamic action parameters...
params: ({ context, event }) => ({
// I cannot get the magic sauce for the correct syntax to invoke the function above with the correct parameters
}),
},
],
},
];

Question on assign and complex context objects
in my use case, the (simplified) context on which I'd like the primaryMachine to operate consists of an object 'data' with readonly properties p1, p2 of types P1Type={subO1:SubO1Type} and P2Type={SubO2Type}. SubO1Type has number of properties with custom setters, and SubO2Type has a number of properties that are object collections (arrays and dictionaries) with custom methods on those object collections. I need to understand how to use assign (actually, enqueue.assign) to call context.data.p1.propertyWithCustomSetter1('newValue'), or context.data.p2.collectionA.remove("anIdToRemove"). All of the assign examples I've found in the documentation (save one) just modify scaler values on the context. The only non-scaler assign I've found in the documents is [Cheatsheet: register an invoked actor with the system](https://stately.ai/docs/system#cheatsheet-explicitly-assign-a-systemid) and it took me a bit of research to understand that it works by returning a shallow copy of an existing array to replace the existing array on its context.

How to structure conditional parallel states
when my machine receives a 'sendQueryEvent' event, it should transition to a sendQueryState which will:

1. assemble data from the sendQueryEvent payload
1. check a flags enum value 'context.data.currentActiveQueryEngines'
1. foreach set bit in the flags variable, invoke in parallel promise-based logic (sendQuery) for the corresponding queryEngine.
1. wait for all queryEngines.sendQuery to return. Individually, each queryEngine logic may resolve to success or error.
1. after all query engines have returned, construct a results object type QueryEventOutputT = {
   responses: {SupportedQueryEnginesEnum, string};
   errors: {SupportedQueryEnginesEnum, string};
   };

How best to layout the state machine?
sendQueryState should be a parent state.
The initial child state is createQueryStringState, which takes the sendQueryEvent payload
and assembles a string (queryString). It uses promise-based async logic and may resolve successfully or with an error.

// how best to architect this part is my question
Solution 1: use parallel child states, one for each enabled queryEngine.
conditionally enter one or more parallel child states.
Each child state has onDone and onError blocks that transition to a state (?) that is waiting on a Promise.all from (??)
Solution 2: use a single child state that invokes an action that waits for Promise.all on individual from-promise actors (??)
Solution 3: use a single child state that invokes a single actor logic that handles all the parallelism
// end how best to architect this part is my question

createQueryResultSummaryState is the last state in sendQueryState.
createQueryResultSummaryState invokes actor logic that takes the individual results from the promise-based logic called above,
creates the QueryEventOutputT object, and returns that object.
createQueryResultSummaryState transitions back to the parent machine's "idleState" if there are no errors
createQueryResultSummaryState transitions back to the parent machine's "errorState" if there are one or more errors in the results object

I think that using Solution 1 is better, but I can't see how to conditionally start a parallel state only if its corresponding flag variable bit is set in context.data.currentActiveQueryEngines

Solution 2 has the same problem, how to conditionally invoke one or more actors based on the values in the context.data.currentActiveQueryEngines

I could go write solution 3, but then the state machine loses all visibility into the individual queryEngines' sendQuery method. I would prefer to see the parallelism in the state machine's definition..

The following code in setup generates the following error on the line `data: {`
'Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'data' does not exist

show an example of a machine CM having two parallel states O and D.
State O is a parallel state with three child states I, P, and U. I is the initial state of O.
I transitions to P on the event QEvent.
P is a parallel state having one child state for each QueryEngineName and a child state W.
the naming convention to use for each QueryEngine child state is QE<Name>, where <Name> is replaced by a value of the QueryEngineNamesEnum
each QueryEngine child state has three child states, named G and F and D.
state G is the initial state of each QueryEngine child state.
state G transitions to state F on event QE<Name>StartEvent.
state F uses the actor logic QFAL. QFAL is a from Promise actor and takes an input of QueryActorLogicInputT and returns QueryActorLogicOutputT
when state F actor logic QFAL is done, the state sets a context field QEResults[QueryEngineName:QueryEngineNamesEnum] = value returned from QFAL of type QueryActorLogicOutputT
state F transitions to state D.
state D is the final state of each QueryEngine child state.
state D raises an event QEDoneEvent.
when state W gets QEDoneEvent, it evaluates a guarded transition to the U state. if the guard is true, it transitions to U, otherwise it continues to wait for another QEDoneEvent.
the guard condition AllQEDoneGuard uses this pure function:
guard: (context, event) => {
assertEvent(context.event, 'xstate.done.actor.waitingForAllActor');
return Object.entries(QueryEngineFlagsEnum)
.filter(
([name, queryEngineFlagValue]) =>
context.context.data.stateManager.currentQueryEngines &
(queryEngineFlagValue as QueryEngineFlagsEnum),
)
.map(([name]) => QueryEngineNamesEnum[name as keyof typeof QueryEngineNamesEnum])
.some(
(engine) =>
(context.context.queryActorsOutput[engine] as QueryActorLogicOutputT).queryResponse ===
undefined &&
(context.context.queryActorsOutput[engine] as QueryActorLogicOutputT).queryError ===
undefined,
);
}
state U executes actor logic ULogic.
when ULogic returns, state U transitions to state I.

when state P is entered it uses the following psuedocode to raise the QE<Name>StartEvent events:
if (context.context.data.stateManager.currentQueryEngines & QueryEngineFlagsEnum.<Name>>) {
context.context.logger.log('raising sQE<Name>StartEvent', LogLevel.Debug);
enqueueActions(({ enqueue }) => {
enqueue.raise({ type: 'QE<Name>StartEvent' });
})};

Using a set of enumeration values to create parts of a machine?
For each value of an enumeration, I need to create events, actions, and states. They vary only in the enumeration value (name).
Both ChatGPT and Gemini suggested using map over the enumeration values, as shown below, but this produces a number of errors.
Is the code below just missing a few magic TS tweaks, or is it simply not possible to define the events, actions and states using map
the enumeration values (which means I will have to boilerplate them all.)

The following is not intended to be a working machine, just to show how I'm trying to use map in each of the event, action, and state sections

````Typescript
export const primaryMachineS = setup({
  types: {} as {
    context: PrimaryMachineContextT;
    input: PrimaryMachineContextT;
    events:
    ...Object.values(QueryEngineNamesEnum).map((name) => ({
      | { type: `querying${name}ActiveEvent`; }
      | { type: `querying${name}InactiveEvent`; }
    }))
  },
  actions: {
    ...Object.values(QueryEngineNamesEnum).map((name) => ({
      `querying${name}StateEntryAction`: (context) => {
        context.context.logger.log(`querying${name}StateEntryAction started`, LogLevel.Debug);
      },
    })),
  },
}).createMachine({
  id:'CM',
  states: {
    ...Object.values(QueryEngineNamesEnum).map((name) => ({
      `querying${name}State`: {
        entry: 'querying${name}StateEntryAction',
        initial: 'G',
        states: {
          G: {
            on: { [`querying${name}ActiveEvent`]: 'F', [`querying${name}InactiveEvent`]: 'D' },
          },
          F: {/* not shown */},
          D: { type: 'final', always: { target: '#CM.W'  }
        }
      }
    }})),
    W: {
      on: {
        queryingDoneEvent: { target: 'U', guard: 'AllQueryingDoneGuard' }
      }
    },
  },
});


adding ```setup``` breaks ```invoke```?
the following simple machine indicates 'invoke' has 8 well-defined generic types as I would expect.

```Typescript
const promiseLogic = fromPromise(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random');
  const dog = await response.json();
  return dog;
});

export const TMachine = createMachine({
    types: {} as {
    context: { dog: string; },
  },
  id: 'TM',
  context: { dog: '' },
  initial: 'A',
  states: {
    A: {
      invoke: {
        id: 'AActor',
        src: 'promiseLogic',
        onDone: {
          target: 'B',
        },
        onError: {
          target: 'C',
        },
      }
    },
    B: {type: 'final'},
    C: {type: 'final'},
  }
});
````

'invoke' is shown as
(property) StateNodeConfig<MachineContext, AnyEventObject, ProvidedActor, ParameterizedObject, ParameterizedObject, string, string, NonReducibleUnknown>.invoke?: SingleOrArray<{
id?: string | undefined;
systemId?: string | undefined;
src: string | AnyActorLogic;
input?: NonReducibleUnknown | Mapper<MachineContext, AnyEventObject, NonReducibleUnknown, AnyEventObject>;
onDone?: SingleOrArray<...>;
onError?: SingleOrArray<...>;
onSnapshot?: SingleOrArray<...>;
}> | undefined

But if I modify the machine to use a setup section as follows:

```Typescript
export const TMachine = setup({
  types: {} as {
    context: { dog: string; }
  }
}).createMachine({
  id: 'TM',
  context: { dog: '' },
  initial: 'A',
  states: {
    A: {
      invoke: {
        id: 'AActor',
        src: 'promiseLogic',
        onDone: {
          target: 'B',
          actions: assign({ dog: ({ event }) => event.output }),
        },
        onError: {
          target: 'C',
        },
      }
    },
    B: {type: 'final'},
    C: {type: 'final'},
  }
});
```

then I get the Typescript error message:
'Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'id' does not exist in type 'readonly never[]'.ts(2353)
types.d.ts(269, 5): The expected type comes from property 'invoke' which is declared here on type 'StateNodeConfig<{}, AnyEventObject, never, never, never, never, string, NonReducibleUnknown>'
(property) id: string'

Could someone kindly point out what is wrong with my setup? It is changing the 'invoke' to one that has completely different generic type constraints. I've been beating my head against this for a few days now... TIA!

How to conditionally spawn actors?

When my machine enters state P, it needs to look at some data in the `context` and conditionally spawn one or more child actors, storing one or more `actorRef` in a context dictionay. All the examples show unconditional spawning of childMachines.

I need something like this:
type QueryActorOutputsT = { [key in QueryEngineNamesEnum]: QueryActorLogicOutputT | undefined };
type QueryActorsT = { [key in QueryEngineNamesEnum]: ActorRef<any,any> | undefined };
type QueryContextT = {
queryService: IQueryService;
queryString: string | undefined;
queryError: Error | unknown | undefined;
queryCancelled: boolean;
queryActorOutputs: QueryActorOutputsT;
queryActorRefs: QueryActorsT
queryCTSToken: vscode.CancellationToken | undefined;
};

```Typescript
/* ... */
entry: [
    assign({
      queryActorRefs: ({ spawn }) => spawn(childMachine, { id: 'child' })
    })
]

spawnChild("someMachine", {
      input (_, params) => ({
        eValue: params.eValue
        qString: params.qString
        value: params.something
       }),
    })

/* this is the conditional logic that looks at a context field and spawns certain children, passing the enumeration's value as an input field */
Object.entries(QueryEngineFlagsEnum)
  .filter(
  // get just the active query engines
  ([name, queryEngineFlagValue]) =>
    context.context.currentQueryEngines &
    (queryEngineFlagValue as QueryEngineFlagsEnum),
  )
  .map(([name]) => QueryEngineNamesEnum[name as keyof typeof QueryEngineNamesEnum])
  .foreach(
    // Somehow I need to
    spawn(childMachine, {
      input (_, params) => ({
        eValue: params.eValue
       }),
    })
    { id: `child${name}`, eValue:${Name} }),
  );
```

Question about `spawn` in V5?

The V4 to V5 migration doc is a bit confusing, it says that `spawn` is deprecated, but then in the very next paragraph goes into detail on how to use `spawn` if you need to store the `actorRef` in `context`.
When I try to `import { spawn } from 'xstate';` in my parentMachine, I get the error message that the xstate package does not export`spawn', as shown in the accompanying screenshot. I'm using xState V5.9.1.
My application is a VSC extension, so I don't include the vue or react packages in my packages.json.
If I want a state to spawn off a new childMachine and store a reference to it in the parent's context, should I be able to use spawn from just the core package?

Best practice to return data from spawned child machines?

When my child actors (machine logic) start (spawns), I store each child actors' ActorRef in a dictionary. When each child actor finishes, I need to signal the parent and return some data. The child machine can send an event to the parent and include all the data in the payload, or, send an event with just the child actor's identifying information (dictionary key), and have the parent machine use the dictionary key to get its ActorRef and then confirm the child actor is done and get the it's snapshot.output. Which is the better practice?

sendTo problems

The following snippet is an `entry:` `action`, I am using `inspect` to log every `inspEvent`, and can see the action being called in the log (`[Debug] StateMachineService @xstate.action actor: quickPickMachine action.type: sendQuickPickMachineDoneEventToParent`), and I can see the logger message in the log (`[Debug] sendQuickPickMachineDoneEventToParent, received event type is xstate.done.actor.quickPickMachineActor, sendingTo x:0`). But I don't see the 'QUICKPICK_DONE' event in the `inspect` stream, and the parent machine is not reacting as expected (transitioning). So I must have done something wrong in writing the `sendTo`. Could someone kindly point out what I've done wrong? TIA!

```Typescript
    sendQuickPickMachineDoneEventToParent: ({ context, event }) => {
      context.logger.log(
        `sendQuickPickMachineDoneEvent, received event type is ${event.type}, sendingTo ${context.parent.id}`,
        LogLevel.Debug,
      );
      sendTo(context.parent, {
        type: 'QUICKPICK_DONE',
      });
    },
```

Followup...

This is the defintion of an action ( I changed its name...) in my machine's `setup...

```Typescript
setup(
/*... */
actions: {
tellSomeoneImFinishedAction: (
   _,
   params: {
     logger: IScopedLogger;
     sendToTargetActorRef: ActorRef<any, any>;
     eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState: any;
   },
 ) => {
   params.logger.log(
     `tellSomeoneImFinishedAction, eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState is ${params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState.type}, sendingTo ${params.sendToTargetActorRef.id}, event is ${params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState}`,
     LogLevel.Debug,
   );
   // discriminate on event that triggers this action and send QUICKPICK_DONE or DISPOSE_COMPLETE
   let _eventToSend: { type: 'QUICKPICK_DONE' } | { type: 'DISPOSE_COMPLETE' };
   switch (params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState.type) {
     case 'xstate.done.actor.quickPickActor':
       _eventToSend = { type: 'QUICKPICK_DONE' };
       break;
     case 'xstate.done.actor.disposeActor':
       _eventToSend = { type: 'DISPOSE_COMPLETE' };
       break;
     default:
       throw new Error(
         `tellSomeoneImFinishedAction received an unexpected event type: ${params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState.type}`,
       );
   }
   // can't quite puzzle out how to get it to return the sendTo Action to be executed
   // none of the following work... I just tried throwing a bunch of different syntax at it to see if anything sticks...
   return sendTo(params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend); // this is the one I expected to work...  It doesn't...
   return sendTo(params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend); // this is the one I expected to work...  It doesn't...
   // return sendTo(() => params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend);
   // ... None of the following are even syntactically correct
   // return sendTo(() => {params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend;});
   // return sendTo((params) => params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend);
   // return sendTo((params) => {params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend});
   // return sendTo(({params}) => params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend);
   // return sendTo(({ params }) => { params.sendToTargetActorRef, _eventToSend});
 },
},
)
```

I can successfull call this action in the entry property of the `outerDoneState`, like this:

```Typescript
outerDoneState: {
  type: 'final',
  entry: [
   {
     type: 'tellSomeoneImFinishedAction',
     params: ({ context, event }) => ({
       logger: context.logger,
       sendToTargetActorRef: context.parent,
       eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState: event,
     }),
   },
    //sendTo(({ context }) => context.parent, { type: 'QUICKPICK_DONE' }), // just FYI, this line, if uncommented, will work...
  ],
},
```

`inspect` shows the action is called and the logger logs the fact that the action was called, with correct parameters, but the parent doesn't get the event...

to @SilentEcho
Thank You! I started my xState journey about 10 weeks ago, and your answer really cleared up a lot of xState action stuff for me. To summarize, I can put the sendTo(...) special action wherever an action can go , and it has two arguments, either or both of which can be a lambda that closes over their params argument. I ended up with the following:

```Typescript
export interface INotifyCompleteActionParameters {
  logger: IScopedLogger;
  sendToTargetActorRef: ActorRef<any, any>;
  eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState: QuickPickMachineCompletionEventsT;
}

setup(
 actions:{
 notifyCompleteAction: sendTo(
  (_, params: INotifyCompleteActionParameters) => {
   params.logger.log(`notifyCompleteAction, in the destination selector lambda, sendToTargetActorRef is ${params.sendToTargetActorRef.id}`, LogLevel.Debug,);
    return params.sendToTargetActorRef;
  },
  (_, params: INotifyCompleteActionParameters) => {
    params.logger.log(`notifyCompleteAction, in the event selector lambda, eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState is ${params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState.type}`, LogLevel.Debug, );
    // discriminate on event that triggers this action and send QUICKPICK_DONE or DISPOSE_COMPLETE
    let _eventToSend: { type: 'QUICKPICK_DONE' } | { type: 'DISPOSE_COMPLETE' };
    switch (params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState.type) {
      case 'xstate.done.actor.quickPickActor':
        _eventToSend = { type: 'QUICKPICK_DONE' };
        break;
      case 'xstate.done.actor.quickPickDisposeActor':
        _eventToSend = { type: 'DISPOSE_COMPLETE' };
        break;
      // ToDo: add case legs for the two error events that come from the quickPickActor and quickPickDisposeActor
      default:
        throw new Error(`notifyCompleteAction received an unexpected event type: ${params.eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState.type}`,);
    }
    params.logger.log(`notifyCompleteAction, in the event selector lambda, _eventToSend is ${_eventToSend.type}`, LogLevel.Debug,);
    return _eventToSend;
  },
 ),
},
).createMachine(
/*...*/
outerDoneState: {
  type: 'final',
  entry: [
   // call the notifyComplete action here, setting the value of the params' properties to values pulled from the context and the event
   // that entered the outerDonestate.
   // When notifyCompleteAction is called, the lambda's supplied as arguments to sendTo (because they close over params), will use the values
   //  set into params here, when the lambdas run
   {
    type: 'notifyCompleteAction',
    params: ({ context, event }) =>
      ({
        logger: context.logger,
        sendToTargetActorRef: context.parent,
        eventCausingTheTransitionIntoOuterDoneState: event,
      }) as INotifyCompleteActionParameters,
    },
  ],
},
/*...*/
)
```

I need contents launch.json and tasks.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.extension.json. tsconfig should transpile all .ts (excpet extension.ts) files in src/\*\* using EMS. tsconfig.extension.json should extend tsconfig.json to transpile only src/extension.ts into extension.js. Output dir is ./\_generated/dist. entry is extension.js. I need webpack.config.js that creates output in ./\_generated/dist for development environment, ./\_generated/tests for testing environment, and ./generated/production for production environment, based on an environment variable named environment having values of development, testing, and production. development and testing should use sourcemaps, production should not. add tasks that run the extension in devlopemtn mode, tasks that run all tests, and a task the transpiles to productio nand then packages the extension for production
