# Starting Again

Going to try and document as I go this time. I need to publish a post about my goals and aspirations for this blog. But I want to get voice dictation integrated into an editor so I can dictate the blog post. I need to ensure I don't go down paths that require more resources than a straightforward solution. So, I'm going to use a format that worked well during my consulting years; a log file that I write notes into every day. I will keep that log under the devlogs folder in the Utilities repository.

# Goals

* Connect with prior acquaintances and meet new people online

## Publish essays and documents regarding ACE, a non-anonymous internet implementation that includes; a game emphasizing co-operative behaviour; a pluggable monitizable system of plug-ins; connectivity across all kinds of devices, and all kinds of users.
