<p>I am actively developing this documentation static website, and publishing to the ATAP Utilities GitHub Pages host. Over the course of the next few weeks, the site will be in a constant state of flux, but hopefully will settle down after the automation tools are completed and content is written.</p>
<h1 id="ataputilities">ATAP.Utilities</h1>
<p>These are a collection of Projects/Assemblies that provide a variety of data structures and algorithms to make programming life easier. Much of the features of ATAP's ACE project and the Blazor-related demos are implemented in these utilities. This repository includes enhancements to Visual Studio, in the form of MSBuild tooling, including MSBuild Tasks, Targets, and properties, along with PowerShell scripts and Modules. The setup and usage instructions for the projects, along with QuickStarts, Guides and Tutorials for these projects and articles on using other 3rd party Open Source Software (OSS) and commercial products to make programming withing Visual Studdio easier are contained in the repository and published to the repository's documentation site, currently hosted in GitHub Pages here: <a href="https://billhertzing.github.io/ATAP.Utilities/Index.html">https://billhertzing.github.io/ATAP.Utilities/Index.html</a></p>
<p>Documentation specifically on using the AutoDoc project within this repository to help you create a static documentation website for your repository can be found here. <a href="./ATAP.Utilities.AutoDoc/Docs/ReadMe.html">here</a></p>
<h2 id="installing--getting-started">Installing / Getting started</h2>
<p>The only way at the moment is to fork the repository, build the packages, and work with your own copy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following distribution methods are under active development, but not yet released beyond local feed. The extended MSBuild tooling in this Repository is where the development and eventual production code will reside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The individual assemblies are distributed as NuGet packages. The entire repository can be installed via NuGet. There is a NuGet package dedicated to installing just the MSBuild tooling enhancements. There is a NuGet package dedicated to installing just the  AutoDoc project to a repository. Instructions for adding individual assemblies to your projects via NuGet: (tbd)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to NuGet, the packages are distributed by Chocolatey. Instructions for getting the MSuild tooling enhancements via Chocolatey: (tbd)</p>

<p>Did you know that there are blogs dedicated to helping you write a ReadMe.md file for a GitHub repository?
<a href="https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme">https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme</a>
<a href="https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices">https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices</a>
The content below came from the  template in <a href="https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices">https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices</a></p>
<p>Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.</p>
<h3 id="initial-configuration">Initial Configuration</h3>
<p>Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, <code>npm i</code>).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.</p>
<h2 id="developing">Developing</h2>
<p>Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
</code></pre>
<p>And state what happens step-by-step.</p>
<h3 id="building">Building</h3>
<p>If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">./configure
make
make install
</code></pre>
<p>Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.</p>
<h3 id="deploying--publishing">Deploying / Publishing</h3>
<p>In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
</code></pre>
<p>And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the main functionality</li>
<li>You can also do another thing</li>
<li>If you get really randy, you can even do this</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.</p>
<h4 id="argument-1">Argument 1</h4>
<p>Type: <code>String</code><br>
Default: <code>'default value'</code></p>
<p>State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">awesome-project &quot;Some other value&quot;  # Prints &quot;You're nailing this readme!&quot;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="argument-2">Argument 2</h4>
<p>Type: <code>Number|Boolean</code><br>
Default: 100</p>
<p>Copy-paste as many of these as you need.</p>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.</p>
<p>These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:</p>
<p>&quot;If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
<code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p>Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project homepage: <a href="https://your.github.com/awesome-project/">https://your.github.com/awesome-project/</a></li>
<li>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/your/awesome-project/">https://github.com/your/awesome-project/</a></li>
<li>Issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues">https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues</a>
<ul>
<li>In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
info@ATAPConsulting.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
to improve the security and privacy of this project!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Related projects:
<ul>
<li>Your other project: <a href="https://github.com/BillHertzing/Ace">https://github.com/BillHertzing/Ace</a></li>
